# Data durability and recovery

In this project you will create highly available solutions to common use cases.  You will build a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region database and show how to use it in multiple geographically separate AWS regions.  You will also build a website hosting solution that is versioned so that any data destruction and accidents can be quickly and easily undone.
